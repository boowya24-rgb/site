    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to share simple fashion ideas and easy clothing tips for everyday life. Many people want
      to feel confident in what they wear, but fashion can sometimes feel confusing, expensive, or overwhelming. This
      website is designed to remove that stress by focusing on realistic, repeatable outfits that anyone can build using
      pieces they already own. Instead of pushing fast trends or high-budget looks, the site highlights clean basics,
      comfortable combinations, and small style tricks that make a noticeable difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another purpose of this site is to give visitors a place where fashion feels approachable. Not everyone has the time
      to scroll through long tutorials or complicated clothing breakdowns. My goal is to keep things simple, encouraging
      users to experiment with what feels like them instead of copying everything exactly. The site breaks down outfit
      ideas step-by-step while still giving enough flexibility for different body types, personalities, and lifestyles.
      This makes the entire experience feel friendly, stress-free, and actually useful.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      This website is for anyone looking for quick outfit inspiration, basic style advice, or easy ways to mix and match
      clothing. The primary audience includes teens, college students, and young adults who want to improve their style
      without spending a lot of money. Many people in this group want guidance, but they prefer short explanations and
      clear examples rather than long fashion articles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The audience also includes beginners who feel unsure about their style. Some visitors may not know where to start
      when choosing colors, layering items, or putting pieces together. This site helps them learn the basics in a simple
      and visual way. The content fits people with busy schedules who need fast ideas they can apply in minutes. Whether
      it’s putting together a school outfit, choosing what to wear on a casual date, or figuring out how to style a simple
      T-shirt, the site aims to answer the questions they commonly have.

    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to Simple Style Guide! The home page introduces the main purpose of the site, which is to help people create
      stylish outfits without complications. Many visitors arrive with the feeling that fashion is hard or meant only for
      people who already know what they’re doing. The home page works to change that by explaining that anyone, at any
      style level, can learn simple tricks that make a big difference. It also previews the other sections of the site,
      encouraging visitors to explore outfit ideas and practical style tips.
    </p>

    <p>
      The home page also highlights the idea that fashion can be fun and expressive. Instead of focusing on buying new items,
      the site encourages people to get creative with what they already own. This helps visitors feel more confident and
      excited about getting dressed each day. With clean visuals, simple icons, and easy navigation, the home page creates
      a welcoming environment for anyone wanting to improve their style in a relaxed and enjoyable way.

    <h3>Outfit Ideas</h3> 
    <p>
      The Outfit Ideas page provides visitors with simple and realistic outfit combinations they can use for everyday life.
      Each example focuses on comfort and style without requiring expensive or hard-to-find pieces. The goal is to show
      outfits that real people actually wear, such as school outfits, casual weekend looks, and simple layered combinations
      that work for different weather conditions. Each outfit explanation includes a quick description of why it works and
      how to adjust it for different occasions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The page also encourages personalization. Instead of telling visitors the “only” way to dress, it gives flexible
      suggestions like changing the color, adding accessories, or swapping shoes to create a different vibe. This makes the
      section helpful for beginners and more experienced fashion lovers. Visitors leave the page with clear examples they
      can try right away, making the site feel practical and trustworthy.
    </p>

    <h3>Style Tips</h3>
    <p>
      The Style Tips page is designed to teach users basic fashion principles in a clear and friendly way. Topics include
      matching colors, choosing good layering pieces, adding accessories, balancing loose and fitted clothing, and building
      a small wardrobe that works for many outfits. Each tip is explained in simple terms so users can apply the advice
      instantly, even if they’re new to styling themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page also helps visitors understand why certain combinations look balanced or visually appealing. Instead of
      focusing on strict rules, it encourages experimentation and confidence. The tips are meant to be tools rather than
      requirements, helping visitors build a stronger sense of their own style. By breaking down fashion into easy,
      manageable steps, the Style Tips page gives users the skills they need to create outfits that feel good and reflect
      their personality.
